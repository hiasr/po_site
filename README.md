# po_site

## Purpose
A small frontend to a University project. This was not required but I found that it added a nice touch and made the project more interesting.
I had been looking for a reason to try out Flask for quite some time.

## How it works
On the buy page you can select what and how much you want to "buy". This "order" then gets sent to an Arduino over Bluetoot which gets all the stuff out of buckets using screws of Archimedes and weighs it.
As an added bonus you can see what's happening in real-time, for this I used an ESP-32-CAM.
